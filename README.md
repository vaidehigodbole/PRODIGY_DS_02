This project involves cleaning and analyzing a passenger dataset. Initially, the dataset is inspected and cleaned by imputing missing values and creating new features. Comprehensive EDA is performed using distribution and count plots to visualize key variables like age, class, and gender. Survival rates are analyzed across different features with bar plots, while advanced visualizations such as heatmaps and pairplots reveal deeper relationships. Age and gender distributions are further examined by survival status, providing insights into the factors influencing survival. These analyses prepare the data for predictive modeling and deeper insights.
